Result：

1. 
I go through to enhance the Macro(vba) program with Vigi, Carmen, and Penny in these days.
We use this enhanced Macro to finish printing invoices and sending emails on 15 Sep working.
but I also need to compare the statement results between Handle and Marco in the end of this month.

2.
The Macro has been put on the shared drive already, just set up the security from the network,
it can run on any machine and any version of Microsoft Excel.

3.
I have designed the invoice and statement web page and workflow,
We had several meetings with Vigi Carmen and Penny to be sure that all of the workflow was suitable for them.
I will talk about the workflow with Vigi, Carmen, and Penny in the process, It make sure the development is right always.

4.
I tried to make a solution to make the template of statement and email format for some special customers.
So, I need to use Microsoft Graph which is Microsoft production, it can make us comply with the edit Excel template online.
if so, web-based will be very flexible for any customers' requirements with their finance statement.

Next step：

Hi Ray and Leo:

I need to get real data to fill the web page, the data includes customers' table, ADR tables, and invoice tables.

So, could you let me know how to connect the database? 

it's better to make me understand these tables, as well as the statistical statement regularly.

If you give me some codes to generate invoice pdf and statement files, it will save much time for me.

You can give me a UAT database account and password to connect it first.

You can give me the Production database when I finish the testing right in UAT.
